# Bindings

To connect your games to `biotrack`, you will need to use the [biotrack HTTP API](./api.md).
However, many games end up using the same language. Thus, we provide
bindings for the following languages:

- [C#](./bindings/csharp.md)

If you would like to contribute bindings for another language, please see the [contributing](./contributing.md) page,
and open an issue or pull request on the [biotrack repository](https://github.com/LeoDog896/biotrack)
